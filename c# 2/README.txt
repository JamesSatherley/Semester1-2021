To avoid test spam, tests are seperated into 5 files of 6 tests; 

 - Positive Real
 - Negative Real
 - Positive Imaginary
 - Negative Imaginary
 - Big Number
 - Empty

For Calculator File (Class Library Project):

 - \assignment2\Calculator.cs

For Test Files (Unit Test Project):

 - \Testing\TestAdd
 - \Testing\TestDivide
 - \Testing\TestMultiply
 - \Testing\TestSqrt
 - \Testing\TestSubtract

According to the marking scheme we are not being tested on commenting. I have commented the Calculator. The tests are straight forward enough
that this isn't needed. The name of each test method describes the test taking place
