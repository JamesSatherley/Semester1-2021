What is the point of the static blocks in the Spray and Wasp classes?

 - The code in a static block is executed before the class is used once allowing initialization and images to load, also meaning you do not need an object to use a static member
 - Static fields are shared by all objects of the class, effectively like a global variable. In the context of Spray and Wasp statics are used to define "global" like variables like MAX_X and MAX_Y
 - which allows them to be referenced elsewhere.

Why are the initialiseSpray and initialiseWasp static methods not included in the static blocks?

 - Code in a static block is executed before the class is used once, thus initialising Wasp and Spray

Why are the above static methods not included in the constructor instead?

 - So the files can be initialised from Exterminator with a give width and height value.
